    <p>Pastel de Tres Leches (or Tres Leche Cake) is a light and fluffy sponge cake soaked with three kinds of milk then topped 
        with homemade whipped cream and cherries! The word "tres leches" means "three milks" (sweetened condensed milk, 
        evaporated milk, and whole milk). This is a classic Hispanic dessert with a deliciously rich, sweet taste.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 eggs, separated</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flou</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>Â½ cup milk</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 cup whipped cream (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced fresh strawberries (Optional)</li>
        </ul>    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Grease a 10x15-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on high until stiff peaks form; gradually beat in 
                sugar until mixture is glossy. Beat in egg yolks, one at a time, combining each yolk before adding the next. 
                Reduce mixer speed to medium and add flour, about 1 tablespoon at a time, to the mixture, beating continuously; 
                beat in baking powder, milk, and vanilla extract. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cake is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean,
                 about 25 minutes. Let cake cool for 15 minutes.</li>  
            <li>Pour 1 cup cream, sweetened condensed milk, and evaporated milk in a blender and pulse several times until well 
                blended. Pour three-milk mixture evenly over the cake. Refrigerate cake until cold and the milk mixture has 
                soaked in, at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Cut in squares and top each serving with a dollop of whipped cream and a few sliced strawberries. Refrigerate leftovers.</li>           
        </ol>        
        </ul>
