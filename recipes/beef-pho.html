    <P>This South Vietnamese style pho brings comfort with every sip and slurp. It's a restorative, richly seasoned broth ladled 
        over rice noodles and thinly sliced beef and served with a host of crisp, tangy, spicy, sweet, and fragrant garnishes.</P>
    <p>The version you see here has been adapted slightly from LETT101's original with insights from Allrecipes friend and 
        Vietnamese cookbook author Andrea Nguyen and tested in our Allrecipes test kitchens. We specified the amount of ginger
         and charred the onion and ginger before adding them to the broth. "That partially cooks those aromatics and kind of 
         mellows things out," says Nguyen. "It's the backbone of the broth."</p> 
    <p>This version also calls for beef soup bones rather than beef knuckle, which can be harder to find, and is served with the
         more traditional hoisin sauce rather than the plum sauce mentioned in the original.</p>        
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 pounds beef soup bones</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>2 medium onions, quartered</li>
            <li>1 (4 inch) piece fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>2 pounds beef oxtail</li>
            <li>1 white (daikon) radish, sliced</li>
            <li>2 ounces whole star anise pods</li>
            <li>½ (3 inch) cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>2 whole cloves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 ½ pounds dried flat rice noodles</li>
            <li>½ pound frozen beef sirloin</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the beef bones in a 9-quart (or larger) pot. Season with salt, and fill pot with 2 gallons of water. 
                Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Put onions and unpeeled ginger on a foil-lined, 10x15-inch roasting pan. Broil 
                4 to 5 inches from heat until onion and ginger are charred, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly. Chop onions. 
                Peel and slice ginger.</li>
            <li>Skim fat from surface of broth, and add oxtail, daikon, and charred onions. Tie anise, cinnamon stick, cloves, 
                peppercorns and charred ginger in a square of cheesecloth; add to broth. Stir in sugar, fish sauce, and 
                remaining 2 tsp. salt. Simmer over medium-low heat at least 4 hours (the longer, the better). Strain broth. 
                Discard spices and bones. Reserve meat from bones for other uses, if desired. Taste broth and add additional 
                alt as needed. Chill overnight</li> 
            <li>Skim fat from top of chilled broth. Bring broth to a boil; reduce heat and keep hot until ready to serve.</li>  
            <li>Cook rice noodles in boiling water according to package directions until soft, but not mushy. Cut sirloin into 
                paper-thin slices.</li> 
            <li>Divide noodles among bowls (1 1/2 cups per bowl). Top each with a few raw sirloin slices. Ladle boiling broth into 
                bowls to cook beef and cover noodles.</li>        
        </ol>
